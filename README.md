Right Volume
============

Right Volume automatically resets the audio volume of your OS X computer to a sane level whenever you connect or disconnect speakers or earphones.

Usage
-----

When the application is started, a small speaker with a check mark appears in the menu bar. Afterwards, whenever you connect or disconnect earphones or speakers, the audio volume will be reset to 10%.

It is recommended that you add Right Volume to your login items (in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items) to have it launched automatically whenever you login.
